    "1. _Ignoring reaction 'EX_4abz_exchg' since it already exists._ This line will come up if a reaction is present in two different community member models under the same ID. This will only happen for exchange reactions in the exchange compartment and are therefor correct behaviour.\n",
    "2. _WARNING: no annotation overlap found for matching metabolite mn2. Please make sure that the metabolite with this ID is indeed representing the same substance in all models!_ This warning comes up if exchange metabolites do not contain any matching annotation field. This can be an indicator that metabolites with the same ID are merged, but they represent different chemicals. Another common cause is that no annotation was given for this metabolite in one of the models.\n",
    "3. _WARNING: matching of the metabolite CO2_EX is unbalanced (mass and/or charge). Please manually curate this metabolite for a mass and charge balanced model!_ This warning means that the formula of an exchange metabolite was different between member models. This can be due to the formula being omitted in some of the models. The other reason is that the metabolites differ in their mass or charge. As this would lead to generation or loss of matter from nothing, these issues need to be resolved for a consistent metabolic model."
